                            <p>USB Audio 2.0 Class Driver and development Tool for Windows As you may know, it's nice to have multiple playback soundcards in Windows for separating out audio stems for mixing, especially with Windows 10's built-in audio routing (v1803 and newer). This is also part of why VB-Audio's and Muzychenko's Virtual Audio Cable is so popular. In pursuit of the mixing convenience of multiple WDM soundcards I went digging to find which interface/mixer manufacturers have Windows drivers that will present the device's many channels over USB/Thunderbolt as multiple. Thesycon develops USb Audio driver and utilities Windows operating systems I can confirm that, at least for my device, the problem is with Killer wifi drivers. Here's what the dpclat looks like with an external USB adapter and without: Huge difference. Now, interestingly, as you can see from the graph, at least for the last 30 minutes I haven't had one of those huge red jumps; that also means my audio hasn't skipped. This happened after I installed a bunch of random drivers. So dpclat still complains, but playback is fine. I believe. Thesycon develop universal drivers, driver templates and development toolkits for Windows operating systems. It includes software toolkit for USB. The toolkit contains a generic device driver which provides Win32 applications with direct access to devices So you just got your brand new DAC, ready to plug it in and enjoy Stereo Quality Music with your home-setup - and then all you hear is crooked music, background noises in the audio-stream, or even worse, absolutely nothing. What to do? (These are mostly software/driver/PC-hardware-side settings. I won't cover DAC-hardware-faults here. Also the Screenshots are in german, don't have access to an english copy of Windows at the moment.) General Settings that are recommended for USB-DAC's anyway. 
Thesycon's TUSBAudio device driver for Windows targets professional USB audio devices and high-end HIFI devices that are compliant to the USB Audio Device Class specification. edit2 So after 4 restarts the issue hasn't come back so I think the nvidial control panel setting mentioned in the first edit did the trick. I'm marking this as solved. Thanks for all the suggestions everyone. end edit edit Thanks everyone for all the great suggestions. After using latency mon, I saw some drivers were having huge spikes. It was usually nvidia drivers on top: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________.

Please note that a USB Audio 2.0 driver is shipped with every INVICTA unit on the provided SDCard. I finally decided to raise the quality of my audio-setup at home, and started by purchasing the Fiio E10 DAC/AMP, which gets recommended quite often for starters. While when it works, the quality is superb, 70% of the time while listening to music/playing an instrument through it (E-Piano per VST) I get a strange crackling noise, as if the sound would be really low quality(which it isn't)/I would get constant buffer-underflows (which i don't). If theres no audio playing, its completely silent. Thesycon develop custom device drivers for Windows operating systems, driver for broadband multimedia, audio and video applications, network drivers for ATM, ISDN and ADSL, drivers for USB, system-level Windows applications, function libraries and firmware. In the process of optimizing my laptop for audio (win7 sp1, inspiron 1750, core2 duo, intel 4 series chipset, 4gb ram), I took a look at DPC Latency Checker ( and noticed that it starts within the acceptable range but then spikes precisely every 15 seconds. I tried disabling or removing various drivers to no avail and then used LatencyMon ( to see what was going on.
