Hey guys, I apologize in advance if I missed out on a rule as it's my first time in this subreddit. I recently received a Wacom Bamboo Tablet CTL-460 from a friend as he no longer needed it. However, when I try to install the driver online, I keep experiencing errors. Most of the videos I've watched on YouTube requires a restart after installing the driver, but I don't get this pop-up aside from the successfully installed message. I've tried a few drivers (5.3.5-3, 6.3.33-3). Для захвата видео и звука Вам, изображенное на рис, либо изначально низкое качество резиновой ленты щетки. Welcome to the Wacom Customer Support enquiry page. Our team is dedicated to providing you with an excellent experience. We're here to answer your questions and resolve any problems  The other day I've borrowed my friends Bamboo Tablet. Once I've decided to connect it, it was recognized and the blue light appeared. At first I thought everything was alright, since it recognized my hand and apparently the pen too since the light turned grey when I put it near the surface. However the pen itself did not work in any of the applications I tried despite being recognized by the tablet. Once I tried to launch the driver the Wacom Center did not list any devices connected

I just downloaded drivers under the "driver for previous generation products" that can be found on https://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/product-support/drivers (https://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/product-support/drivers) They say "drivers for Bamboo Create, Capture, Connect, Splash, Bamboo CTL, Bamboo CTH, and One by Wacom" so my Bamboo Fun CTE-650 is not directly listed, but are the only one with a lot of other Bamboo(s) listed. Despite that, my Bamboo pressure levels are ignored

A hardware driver is a small computer program that allows your computer to interact with Wacom products. It is important to download the most recent driver to ensure that your device is working properly and that you can access its full array of features. I'm currently trying to install the drivers for my Bamboo CTH-670. I have the disc (the only reason I don't use it being my DVD player doesn't work), and the driver version stated on it is "Bamboo tablet driver v. 5.3.0 WINDOWS / 5.3.0 MAC". I've tried looking on the driver download list on the Wacom website, but it's only given the Mac download and nothing else. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

So just curious if anyone uses other brands and how they work for you.

I drew a lot since I was able to hold a pencil and started using an old cheap noname graphic tablet of my brother 2 months ago. Now I want to buy one because I got kinda addicted and just took a look at different wacom products. Can somebody tell me the difference between the Wacom Intuos Pro tablets and the Wacom PTH-651 / 851-DEIT Intuos Pro tablets Edit: Thanks to anybody answering this question. Thats a real nie community.

Does anyone know if there will be a 64 bit version of the driver set for some of the older models of tablet out there? At the moment I can only seem to find 32 bit drivers for my Splash. This will be an issue when macOS Mojave gets released and 32 bit support is dropped. Thanks. Tablets have made computing easier and more convenient by combining the functionality of a laptop with the portability of an e-reader or smartphone. Some devices have been built for more specific functions, allowing consumers to buy a tablet that suits their individual needs. For artists and graphic. I can't seem to find the right drivers, everything I install seem to not detect my tablet. The base operating system does recognise though. EDIT: It's been 2 months and I have just stumbled upon this (https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/87syes/cth661_driver_installation/e2s1001/) comment made by /u/daruvante. Downloading this version of the Bamboo driver made me able to configure my wacom tablet and use it's full functionality again! (Apart from the dock, because that is still not available v.v) Direct link to download I was recently bought a (probably used) Wacom Bamboo Pen ( CTL-460 ) and installed the driver via the installation disk. I've been getting errors attempting to access the Wacom Tablet Properties, I was trying to enable pen pressure. It prompted me to either shut off my computer and turn in back on or to switch the ports in where my tablet was plugged in. I was trying to see if I could reinstall the drivers but I can't find them in device manager, not under Human Interface Devices Alright, so a week or two ago I'm guessing that the wacom new driver update messed up a lot of stuff. I have windows 10, a Bamboo Pen CTL 470. When I plug it into my laptop the tablet lights up as usual, but it won't register the pen. At first it didn't recognize it at all, now the cursor jumps all over the page when I use the pen like some superior lag. I've reinstalled current drivers, previous drivers, switched USB ports, restarted upon each reinstall, when i click "set up pen and tablet". 
Hi! I recently had to downgrade to an old Dell vostro 200 running Windows Vista. (Not my first choice, but it was free). While setting it up I tried to install the drivers for my Wacom Bamboo fun art tablet. It's an older tablet and Wacom does provide drivers that are supposed to work on Vista. When I download and install the newest drivers, restart my computer, and plug my tablet in it is recognized by the computer right away. While it is "installing the drivers" the computer refers What do you think about this one https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ugee-M708-10x6-5080-LPI-Graphics-Art-Drawing-Tablet-Design-Pad-w-Digital-Pen/132026910989?epid=2256025962amphash=item1ebd6ac90d:g:zGIAAOSwRUhY9KAQ do you think its good? could i find any better. I'm currently using 5.3.5-3, but I really feel the input lag compared to using the wacom intuos with 6.3.9w5 drivers. 
Hello i'm trying to get into drawing and painting and wanted to buy a graphics tablet, but since i'm just a student (not art, technical field actually) my budget is kinda slim (100 USD tops, so pricing is a biggy :S ),anyways, i have read that Huioins are a good cheap version, but they seem kinda plastic and clunky from teh YT review videos ( i get that they are cheap, but still), wacoms seem to be the "prefered" thing online, but they seem kinda pricy, although there are 60$ versions Asking my dad about it, it looks to be a conflict between the basic mouse and wacom drivers, but I'm not sure for certain. Any news or updates if this a thing occuring for anyone else? Perhaps there was an update that conflicted things? http://i.imgur.com/7tRGTWW.gif. Pen amp Touch: https://www.pcper.com/images/reviews/829/icon7.jpg I'm getting about 10+ms of input lag and I need to fix this. I have the latest drivers. EDIT THIS ISSUE IS SOLVED NOT USING THE DISC The driver that came with the disc in my CTL-471 doesn't work and said that a supported tablet is not detected. I have downloaded it online and restarted the consumer and professional services. All of them yielded the same results. I need to use my tablet for drawing and osu, and would like some help asap. Anyone who helps is deeply appreciated. A supported tablet was not found on the system. ( on Windows 10.1 64bit using a Wacom Bamboo CTL-470 using the latest xx.20.xx Wacom Tablet software/driver bundle didn't work neither did the 6.3.15-3 which worked for others using Intuous 4 from which I googled. I recently had to re-calibrate my tablet, but Wacom Tablet Properties wasn't working. I talked to customer service, and they recommended uninstalling and reinstalling the tablet software. I was able to download the drivers, but can't install Wacom Tablet Properties because my software disc is out of date. Now I can't calibrate my tablet, and I can't find a download online for Wacom Tablet Properties. Any suggestions? Edit: I have a wacom bamboo and am using windows. Just got an unopened one from my brother; drivers worked for a littler bit, I installed newer ones and now they aren't working correctly. Pressure in SAI is gone after I reverted 
Hello! It's my first time buying a drawing tablet and I figured asking people who has experience in these would be best. I've read some reviews from others and it seemed Wacom is long lasting and totally of good quality. However, I've also seen people say that the new Intuos line is terrible? So I'm confused on what to buy. I'm only buying online so my choices are quite limited. These are what I'm deciding on: Sorry if this isn't quite art-related? I found an old drawing. The new Bamboo driver supporting macOS 10.12 has been released. It can be downloaded from here: From a Wacom email: "As a note, if you have a Intuos or Cintiq tablet driver installed on the same computer, the two drivers will not work together. Wacom will be releasing a new Intuos/Cintiq driver next week that will work with this Bamboo Driver, until then please do not use both drivers on the same computer.". 绿色资源网收集的丽境960数位板驱动可以用来解决数位板无法连接到电话，或数位板缺少驱动程序等问题。驱动安装时提供.
