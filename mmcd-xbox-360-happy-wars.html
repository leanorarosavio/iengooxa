Happy Wars. ÁÑ°Êñô„É°„É≥„Éê„Éº„Åß„ÇÇÈÅä„Åπ„Çã. Xbox 360. „Ç≤„Éº„É†„Çπ„Éà„Ç¢„ÅØ„Åì„Å°„Çâ. Man. Just decided to get off of Fortnite and hop on HW for the 1st time of the month. Then i sat back n thought about hooking up my dusty old 360 to see what was HW like, mind you literally my 1st time signing online on 360 in 2018. Come to find out Toylogic doesn't even support and renew 360 HW Limited Edition pack openings anymore, My god I've been living in tha stone Ageüòµ lol HW for 360 is done. Also how is everyone here doing? Haven't logged into this Reddit in months. Goosie? All games look and play great on Xbox One X.But select Xbox One X Enhanced titles are optimized to take full advantage of the world‚Äôs most powerful console. Xbox One X unleashes 6 teraflops of graphical processing power, making games perform better Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is an action-adventure platform video game developed and published by LucasArts.It is the second installment of The Force Unleashed multimedia project, and the sequel to Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (2008). Probably because they know they would get whopped w/o cheats/special hidden features only they had access to. I know what you are up to HW developers, send me a message (aka mystic rinx) when you feel like playing xbox 360 happy wars. #get #recked #noobs. we made it folks, tl has officially decided to kick everyone off the 360 and 10 to get the xbone. they couldn't even fix the w10 servers. aye, how sucky. hooo boy, has long has it been? five years? and for us 360 folk? i wont be surprised if ms kicks the bucket this year and shuts down the xbl service for us. we have until december 18th until tl officially closes the doors might as well start our last tbags, clan matches, trash talks and all the funsies for us 360 who don't Happy Wars on the Xbox one and 360 are two different games. with the 360 being way better Xbox one hw hit detection is completely off. it‚Äôs crazy how bad it is. it‚Äôs almost like you‚Äôre fighting the silhouette of ppl Xbox one hw will not let u find a lobby. there will be 5 ppl solo queuing. and it won‚Äôt group them up. it‚Äôs crazy how bad the connectivity issue is. considering it‚Äôs an Xbox one game You wanna try hard and win with a terrible team? Well if the terrible off balance doesn‚Äôt. 
Xbone happy wars is shit. with shit players PTC still. So when HW from 360 finally Retires you guys think HW for Xbox 1 will be revived ( Player Status wise?) it would be nice to at least find lobbies a little bit more faster. I don't know i still enjoy. apparently the game was accidentally released due to a "system glitch" and the developers don't want us to play it as it might fuck with our saves full post here: https://www.facebook.com/HappyWars/posts/852084194851468. Post all names of people who have hacked buffs. It's time to get these people banned. Super BUFFS INCLUFED. I've completely proven that we smack the dogshit out of the shit squad, they've been backing out and afraid of us for months. Even with Azazel they can't beat us, and now with him gone, the idea of them winning a match against us is laughable. Not only does SS suck, but they also all cheat horrendously. Still can't win against us thoughüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. It's now tax season, time for you fools to upgrade y'all systems. Looking forward to the 360 dieing out. Bt on that note. Happy wars on xb1 would be a lot better if the 360 died alot faster, and all u finagles Hey guys! Got the codes to all four games! Let me know what games you want and what your story with Gears of war is, i'll have a read through and will give away the codes if I see a story that catches my eye! Will keep you updated on which codes have gone! :-) happy New Years! Edit 1: Gears 3 code gone Edit 2: Judgement code gone Edit 3: off to bed, will hand out 1 and 2 codes tomorrow! Edit 4: Gears 1 code gone Edit 5: Gears 2 code gone! Hope everyone that received a code enjoys. You are all playing against little kids and other poor ppl that most likely can't even afford good gear,also terrible connections cause poor ppl internet.most have been on since 2012 so your prolly about 9-10yo.every grown player has moved to one except the few older scrubs with no job or just wanna farm 6 year olds on 360.lol the jackass going on about I'm dumb cause I'd run ice over mob LMFAO the framerate isn't 10fps so my avatar actually moved proper fast without mob lol I need mobility. Illuminaughties confirmed? ‚óáWhat do you guys think? ‚óáFrom my perspective, it appears that the Illumi N aughtys' agenda is working.so far. I for one refuse to let them have their way and am staying in the fight üòê √µ_√µ hmph~, naughty Illuminaughties üòë -__-'. 
Update: Toylogic have come out with a blurb press where they mention that the Xbox One version was NOT suppose to be released. However, if you did download the game (or queue it from the Xbox Store site), you will be able to play it with no issues. However. Once you start the game up and choose to update your save data. You will NOT be able to return to the Xbox 360 version until the Season 3 update is officially out. I'll keep everyone updated on what happens down the line. For anyone. Honestly wtf it'd severely help the game since the community would no longer be split and it'd make room for bigger changes (well, maybe) Also if you don't have a One but still continuously spend thousands on tickets fuck you Edit: another thing worth mentioning is the horrible frame rate on the 360 version for many of the maps, its unbearable. The one handles everything much more smoothly. IGN is the leading site for Xbox games with expert reviews, news, previews, game trailers, cheat codes, wiki guides walkthroughs.
